# README-Generator
This application was created using node.js to generate professional README.md docs from the command line, and aims to cut down on the amount of time developers are using to write their README.md files. This way more of their time can be devoted to creating, maintaining, and updating their applications. By the use of inquirer (node package manager) this application takes the user through a series of prompts, asking them their name, title of their application, application description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, test instructions, what type of license they want their application to be covered under, as well as their GitHub handle, and primary email. Once all prompts are answered, the application generates a professional README.md markdown file with the users inputs. 

## User Story
